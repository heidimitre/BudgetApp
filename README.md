# BudgetApp
A Java-based tool for managing a monthly household budget.

This application is currently under development.

BudgetApp is a GUI-based Java application which allows users to input income, expense and asset information.  BudgetApp calculates excess monthly cash flow and assists with monthly budget planning for a household.

Using the household creation tab, users can create a profile for their household as well as additional households to simulate alternate (what-if) scenarios.

Within a household, users can add income sources, monthly expenses, asset amounts (bank balances, etc.).  Users can also add expected one-time expenses that are not incurred on a recurring basis.

Features to be added in the future include basic tax planning and savings calculations.
